# Accident-Survived-Prediction-using-Naive-Bayes
The naive Bayes Algorithm is one of the popular classification machine learning algorithms that helps to classify the data based upon the conditional probability values computation. It implements the Bayes theorem for the computation and used class levels represented as feature values or vectors of predictors for classification. Naive Bayes Algorithm is a fast algorithm for classification problems. This algorithm is a good fit for real-time prediction, multi-class prediction, recommendation system, text classification, and sentiment analysis use cases. Naive Bayes Algorithm can be built using Gaussian, Multinomial and Bernoulli distribution. This algorithm is scalable and easy to implement for a large data set.
Using this algorithm we are predicting the person is survived or not in the accident.
